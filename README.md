**While running:**  
Type in your first card. As long as you pick a card between 1 and 10 or a face card, you will then be able to enter your second card. If you do not choose an appropriate card, the program will continue prompting you for another card until you do.

Next, type in the card you've selected to represent the dealer's up card.

Based on your input, the program will return the best next move you should make to optimize your chances of winning.
